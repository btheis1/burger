# burger
MySQL, Node, and Handlebars app that lets users list foods they want to eat and then click a button to store the foods as "eaten". 

This application is useful as a "To-Do" type app, where users can keep track of actions (or Burgers) that they've already accomplished. 

Start out on this site by typing in a burger that you want to eat, and then hit submit! Click, "Devour It!" when you're ready to eat the burger.
